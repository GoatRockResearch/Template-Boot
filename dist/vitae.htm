				<h4 id="adjunct-professor-digital-research-methods-hum-340"><small>Adjunct Professor, Digital Research Methods (HUM 340)</small></h4>
				<p>Summer 2007, 2008, &amp; 2009; Spring 2010, 2011 &amp; 2012</p>
				<p>School of Arts &amp; Humanities, Claremont Graduate University</p>
				<p>In consultation with CGU Arts and Humanities faculty, designed and taught a course to provide conceptual and practical experience in applying information technologies to support critical thinking and promote the ongoing integration of information literacy in humanities research and publishing. Digital Humanities is a collaborative approach to scholarship that combines traditional forms of humanistic study with informational technologies that have had and will have a role in shaping scholarship	within the humanities. The course explored the core concepts of the digital humanities both theoretically and practically through discussion and “hands–on” experience using informational technologies to promote information literacy. Students developed digital skills, including information trapping, citation management, social media, and web development and publishing, as well as gained a greater understanding of the basic tools and &#8220;languages&#8221; of a digital humanist and their impact on humanistic study.</p>

				<h4 id="web-design-guest-lecturer-digital-humanities-hum-340"><small>Web Design Guest Lecturer, Digital Humanities (HUM 340)</small></h4>
				<p>Summer 2004 – 2006</p>
				<p> School of Arts &amp; Humanities, Claremont Graduate University</p>
				<p>Designed and taught a workshop session on web design for <span class="initialism">HUM</span> 340. Workshop sessions stressed creating user&#8211;centered websites that accommodated a variety of different users, adhered to fair use in content, and separated structure from presentation. The core goal was to demonstrate, through engaging with web development, the possibilities inherent not just in creating academic websites but in becoming familiar with using and learning to use digital technologies.</p>

				<p>2012, School of Arts &amp;amp; Humanities, Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, California.</p>
				<p>Presentation emphasized sharing what I know, and have learned, about the digital tools and methods available to scholars to help them with doing, managing, and publishing research. Companion blog post: &#8220;Digital Tools and Methods: Ideas and Links.&#8221;</p>

				<h4 id="hashtags-the-3-mes-and-the-digital-environmental-dissertation."><small>“Hashtags, the 3 Me’s, and the Digital Environmental Dissertation.”</small></h4>
				<p><a href="http://aseh.net/conference-workshops">American Society for Environmental History</a>, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, March 2012.</p>
				<p>Participated on a panel that sought to engage the wider <span class="initialism">EH</span> community about the digital tools and projects being used and developed, and to encourage the community to think about how digital technologies are changing scholarship. Panel was proposed and organized via Twitter, following a Twitter conversation on defining a hashtag (#envhist) for Environmental scholars, planned and written using Google Docs, and shared through blog posts post&#8211;conference.

				<h4 id="shakespeare-in-the-sandbox."><small>&#8220;Shakespeare in the Sandbox.&#8221;</small></h4>
				<p>Guest Lecture for Professor Lori Ann Ferrell, Claremont Graduate University, 2010</p>
				<p>Invited to guest lecture for a trans&#8211;disciplinary course on Shakespeare about developing a website for the course project. Students in the course sought to demystify the boundaries that keep students (particularly at the community college level)	and readers from accessing Shakespeare. With this in mind I presented on the idea of the &#8220;Sandbox&#8221; from gaming culture (which uses an open&#8211;ended environment and narrative that encourages exploration and open&#8211;ended game play), and encouraged the class to use the <span class="initialism">NEH</span> Start&#8211;Up Level 1 grant to propose, rather than actually build, a website that would help meet their goal.</p>

				<p><a href="http://socal2010.thatcamp.org/">THATCamp SoCal</a>, Chapman University, Orange, California, March 2010</p>
				<p>Proposed and participated in a session that explored what, how, and why we should be teaching digital research methods in the humanities. Session participants developed a core list of technologies and methods that should be considered in teaching digital literacy, which included search programs and languages (e.g., regular expressions), web development, and database design.</p>
